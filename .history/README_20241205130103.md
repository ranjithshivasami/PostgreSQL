### 3. **What are the different data types in PostgreSQL?**  
- **Numeric**: `INTEGER`, `SERIAL`, `FLOAT`, `NUMERIC`  
- **Character**: `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`  
- **Date/Time**: `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `INTERVAL`  
- **Boolean**: `BOOLEAN`  
- **JSON/JSONB**

### 4. **What is the difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR`?**  
- `CHAR(n)`: Fixed-length, padded with spaces if necessary.  
- `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length, up to `n` characters.  

### 5. **How do you create a database in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

### 6. **How do you list all databases in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
\l
```

### 7. **What is a schema in PostgreSQL?**  
A schema is a namespace within a database used to organize tables, functions, and other database objects.

### 8. **How do you create a table in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 9. **How do you delete a table in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

### 10. **What is the difference between `DROP` and `TRUNCATE`?**  
- `DROP`: Deletes the table and its structure.  
- `TRUNCATE`: Removes all rows but retains the table structure.

## **Intermediate Questions**

### 11. **What is a primary key in PostgreSQL?**  
A primary key is a column or group of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.

### 12. **What is a foreign key?**  
A foreign key is a column in one table that references a primary key in another table to establish relationships.

### 13. **What are indexes in PostgreSQL?**  
Indexes improve query performance by providing faster access to rows in a table.

### 14. **How do you create an index in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
```

### 15. **What are the types of indexes in PostgreSQL?**  
- **B-Tree**: Default index for most use cases.  
- **Hash**: For equality comparisons.  
- **GIN**: For full-text search and JSONB.  
- **GiST**: For spatial data.  
- **BRIN**: For large sequential data.

### 16. **What is a `VIEW` in PostgreSQL?**  
A `VIEW` is a virtual table based on a query.  
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

### 17. **What is a materialized view?**  
A materialized view stores the result of a query physically, unlike a normal view.

### 18. **How do you update a row in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column_name = value
WHERE condition;
```

### 19. **How do you perform a JOIN in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM table_a a
JOIN table_b b
ON a.id = b.foreign_id;
```

### 20. **What are the different types of JOINs in PostgreSQL?**  
- INNER JOIN  
- LEFT JOIN  
- RIGHT JOIN  
- FULL JOIN  
- CROSS JOIN

### **Advanced Questions**

### 21. **How do you create a JSON column in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data JSONB
);
```

### 22. **What is the difference between `JSON` and `JSONB`?**  
- `JSON`: Stores data as plain text.  
- `JSONB`: Stores data in a binary format for faster querying.

### 23. **What is a transaction in PostgreSQL?**  
A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single unit of work.  

### 24. **What are the transaction isolation levels in PostgreSQL?**  
- READ UNCOMMITTED  
- READ COMMITTED (default)  
- REPEATABLE READ  
- SERIALIZABLE  

### 25. **How do you start a transaction in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
BEGIN;
-- SQL Statements
COMMIT;
```

### 26. **How do you roll back a transaction?**  
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

### 27. **What is a `CTE` (Common Table Expression)?**  
A CTE is a temporary result set used in complex queries.  
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT column1 FROM table_name
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

### 28. **What are window functions in PostgreSQL?**  
Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.  
```sql
SELECT id, name, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column1) FROM table_name;
```

### 29. **How do you implement full-text search in PostgreSQL?**  
Using `tsvector` and `tsquery`:  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_fts ON table_name USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', column_name));
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE to_tsvector('english', column_name) @@ to_tsquery('search_term');
```

### 30. **How do you monitor query performance in PostgreSQL?**  
Using `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:  
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

### **More Advanced Questions**

31. **What is a sequence in PostgreSQL?**  
A sequence generates unique identifiers, often used with `SERIAL`.

32. **What is the role of `pg_stat_activity`?**  
It provides information about active queries and connections.

33. **What is the `VACUUM` command?**  
It reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples and updates statistics.  

34. **What is the difference between `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE`?**  
- `VACUUM`: Reclaims storage.  
- `ANALYZE`: Updates query planner statistics.

35. **What are table partitions in PostgreSQL?**  
Table partitioning divides a table into smaller tables for performance optimization.

36. **What is the purpose of the `pg_hba.conf` file?**  
It controls client authentication in PostgreSQL.

37. **How do you create a trigger in PostgreSQL?**  
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
AFTER INSERT ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_function();
```

38. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication?**  
- Synchronous: Waits for confirmation from replicas.  
- Asynchronous: Doesn’t wait for confirmation.

39. **What is the difference between logical and physical replication?**  
- Logical: Replicates data at the logical level (e.g., tables).  
- Physical: Copies entire database blocks.

40. **What is the `pg_dump` command?**  
It creates a backup of a PostgreSQL database.
